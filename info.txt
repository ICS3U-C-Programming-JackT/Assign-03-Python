Hello Ms.Raffin! 

I hope that you enjoy my program so far, 
but there are a few things that I need 
you to know before you play.

If you check the constants.py file, it 
contains a constant called OVERRIDE_WORD, 
which upon being switched to true will make the 
mystery word always equal to "hangman".

This is important for testing purposes in cases 
where I need to know the word, please use this 
if you need to test my program.

Starting lives are of course also editable for 
if you want a harder challenge.

Files: 
words.py: This file contains over 300 words that are randomly selected from
icons.py: This file contains the icons for the hangman
constants.py: This file contains different constants so they aren't edited by accident in hangman.py
hangman.py: This file operates the whole game containing multiple functions that are all used within a small while loop
info.txt: This file is purely instructional
